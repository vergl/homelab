# Terraform
Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as a code software tool that enables you to safely and predictably create, change, and improve infrastructure.

## Prerequisites
### Install Terraform CLI
Documentation: [Install Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)

Installation on MacOS with *brew*:
```bash
brew tap hashicorp/tap
brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform
```

## Main commands

### Initialize Terraform
```bash
terraform init
```

### Test configuration
```bash
terraform plan
```

### Run configuration (create VMs)
```bash
terraform apply
```


### Run specific configuration (create VMs)
```bash
terraform apply -target=resource_type.resource_name
```

### Remove configuration (destroy VMs)
```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Useful options
- *--auto-approve* - Disables prompt for approve
- *TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS* - Environment variable for debugging providers. Value for the variable is generated 
by the provider library when run in debug mode
- *-parallelism=n* - Limit the number of concurrent operations as Terraform walks the graph.

## Configuration
- Create a file with an extension *.auto.tfvars* with variable values. Example data is stored in the file *example-credentials.tfvars*

## Problems I faced

### Occasional errors on run
Sometimes Proxmox returns lock errors or VM just gets bugged. Looks like nothing you can do about it,
so destroy/apply the configuration one more time. 

Also, it's a good idea to check VMs state after such errors because they don't get destroyed from time to time and
you have to do it manually. 

Unfortunately, this problem is quite common and makes using Terraform less convenient than it was supposed to be.

*Workaround:* set `-parallelism=1` to decrease the chance of locks and other problems.

### VMs don't get the IP address from cloud-init configuration
There is a [Github Issue](https://github.com/Telmate/terraform-provider-proxmox/issues/603) with it. After debugging
*terraform-provider-proxmox* and *proxmox-api-go* I realized that it is the problem on the side of Proxmox itself (tested on 7.2 and 7.3, the problem still exists).

VM gets the IP address from DHCP on the first boot, even though it was set as static in `ipconfig0` in cloud-init settings.  Nevertheless, this VM gets static IP after reboot, so the workaround I found was **remote-exec** provider which reboots the machine manually after it was created.

```terraform
  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo shutdown -r +0"
    ]
    connection {
      type     = "ssh"
      host     = self.ssh_host
      user     = "${var.ssh_user}"
      password = "${var.ssh_password}"
      port     = self.ssh_port
    }
  }
```
